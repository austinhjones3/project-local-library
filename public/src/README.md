## This is a project in which all except the /public/src folder was provided to me by Thinkful. The code inside of /public/src is my own. The rest is not.

### Important notes about design decisions

- #### using .forEach() instead of .reduce() in some cases
  I found that `.forEach()` helped me write some functions a little cleaner than `.reduce()` would have, so in some cases `.reduce()` is not used where it could be. If I am wrong, please let me know!
