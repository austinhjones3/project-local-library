## This is a project in which all except the /public/src folder was provided to me by Thinkful. The code inside of /public/src is my own. The rest is not.

- #### Run
  In order to run the tests for this project and see my code working and passing the tests, please clone this repo to your machine, navigate to the clone directory in bash, and run `npm test`.
- #### using .forEach() instead of .reduce() in some cases
  I found that `.forEach()` helped me write some functions a little cleaner than `.reduce()` would have, so in some cases `.reduce()` is not used where it could be. If I am wrong, please let me know!
